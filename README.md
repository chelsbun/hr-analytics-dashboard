## 🚀 TL;DR

Automates HR data audits, compliance, and reporting—transforming 30-minute manual processes into 3-second analytics.  
Built with advanced SQL, dynamic JavaScript, and Workday-style integrations. Inspired by real-world Insperity experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive HR analytics and reporting system built for modern HRIS/PEO/Workday use cases.  
It automates complex data audits, benefits analytics, demographic reports, and simulates real-world data integration (EIB) workflows—mirroring the challenges I encountered as an HR specialist at Insperity.

**Key value:**
- Automates manual audits (missing/invalid SSNs, benefit compliance, payroll checks)
- Delivers actionable business insights (cost analysis, enrollment patterns)
- Simulates Workday-style reporting, data import, and integration

## 💼 Business Context

This project directly reflects the *actual pain points* faced in HR operations:

- Reduces compliance and audit errors that can trigger IRS penalties or billing issues
- Models a **multi-client environment** (like Insperity/PEO/HRO) with cross-client analytics
- Brings Workday-level automation and business logic to everyday HR tasks

### What Makes This Stand Out?

- **Not just a CRUD dashboard:** all features mirror real HR business processes  
- **Built with actual SQL and data models** used in enterprise HR/PEO environments  
- **Demonstrates both technical and domain expertise**

## ✨ Key Features & Impact

### 📊 Advanced SQL Analytics

- **Data Quality Audit:** Instantly finds missing/invalid SSNs, benefit mismatches, or payroll errors—compliance issues surface in seconds, not hours.
- **Benefits Cost Analysis:** Year-over-year cost breakdowns and multi-dimensional trending across clients—enables proactive cost management.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Salary band and enrollment reports—spot trends, disparities, or opportunities for engagement.

### 🔌 Integration Tools Simulation

- **EIB-Style Data Import:** Drag-and-drop file upload, real-time validation, error handling, and metrics.  
  Activity logs and import statuses mirror what HR teams use daily in Workday.
- **Multi-System & Sync Management:** Simulate data sync across multiple HRIS systems (Insperity HRIS, ADP, BambooHR, etc.), with configuration for scheduling and error handling.

### 📋 Report Writer & Calculated Fields

- **Interactive Report Builder:** Drag-and-drop fields, live report preview, export, and schedule.
- **Workday-Style Calculations:** Custom business formulas (e.g., Years of Service, % of Salary, Total Compensation) with readable syntax.
